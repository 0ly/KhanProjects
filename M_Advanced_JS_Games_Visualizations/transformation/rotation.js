//step one
/*
The goal of this challenge is to create a color wheel using many rotated copies of a single rectangle.

The program currently draws a rectangle whose upper-left corner is in the upper-left corner of the screen. Your task for this step is to use a translation to move the upper-left corner of the rectangle to the center of the screen.
*/
//step two
/*
Now, generate a wheel by using 12 rectangles, with each rectangle rotated 30 degrees more than the previous rectangle. To do this, you will use two new components: a for loop and a rotation.
*/
//step three
/*
Finally, let's turn the wheel into a color wheel by using a different color for each rectangle.

Make the change in colors, around the color wheel, smooth by incrementing or decrementing each of the r,g, and b values by a constant amount for each rectangle.
