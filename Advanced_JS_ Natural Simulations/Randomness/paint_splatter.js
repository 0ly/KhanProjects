/*Consider a simulation of paint splatter drawn as a collection of colored dots. Most of the paint clusters around a central location, but some dots do splatter out towards the edges. In this project, use what you've learnt to draw the paint splatter:

Use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate the locations of the dots.
Bonus: use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate a color palette.*/
