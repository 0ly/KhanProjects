//step one
/*
You're going to tell the story of Leafers, who starts as a seed and grows to Leafer's ultimate form, using scenes.

We've provided you with, drawScene1, a scene drawing function for the first scene where Leafers is just a seed, and drawScene5, a scene drawing function for the fifth (and last) scene where Leafers is in ultimate form.

Your task for this step is to add logic to the mouseClicked function so that :
- If the first scene is displayed and you click the mouse, it will display the last scene
- If the last scene is displayed and you click the mouse, it will display the first scene
*/
// step two
/*
Add the second, third and fourth scenes to fill in the rest of the story.

Each scene should:
- update the scene index, currentScene, to the scene number
- draw a unique background
- display the image of Leafers
- have text describing the scene

In the second scene Leafers should be a seedling, in the third scene Leafers should be a sapling, and in the fourth scene Leafers should be a tree.

Don't worry about adding logic to mouseClicked to display these scenes in this step. You will do that next step.
